Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

For this challenge I created my own page  which will be added to over time to become my own personal portfolio of work. I used what I have learned in the first two weeks of the bootcamp to write the HTML and CSS from scratch, while keeping in mind the following requirements:
    Understanding semathical hmtl structure, including aboutme, work, contact
    Used necessary elements as well as attribute like img,nav,flex box, grid, etc.
    Included my selfie in the webpage
    In this assigment, about work section I demo several things based on what i have learned and understanding, i will Update projects later on, so that i temporarily added images. 
    The page was styled for smaller screen sizes
    I also included some on hover effects for the various links and the projects on the page.
    Screenshots added in the image show the assigment completed
